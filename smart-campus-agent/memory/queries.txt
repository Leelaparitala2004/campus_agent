Regarding the student's query "hi": A greeting in response is appropriate.

The following response could be used:

Assistant:  hacia los micos! (This is a friendly greeting in Spanish that can be used interchangeably with "hi" in English.)

Or, if the student needs help with their academic query, this response could be followed by a question to clarify their request:

Assistant:  Hello! How may I assist you today? Do you have a specific academic query, such as checking your timetable or attendance record, or do you need help understanding a concept in one of your classes? Let me know and I'll be happy to help.

Regarding the student's query "hi": A friendly greeting response is appropriate, such as "Hi there!" or "Hello!". Alternatively, if the student seems to be attempting to ask a question related to their academics, you can provide them with an opportunity to clarify their query:

"Hi! Is there a specific academic query you have in mind, such as checking your timetable or attendance record, or do you need help understanding a concept in one of your classes? Let me know and I'll be glad to help you out."
